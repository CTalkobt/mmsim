# Machine Descriptor JSON Format

This document defines the JSON schema used to describe and reconstruct the various 8-bit machine architectures supported by **mmsim**. These descriptors are located in the `machines/` directory and are used by the `JsonMachineLoader` (`libcore`) to instantiate machines at runtime.

---

## Architectural Constraint

> **Machine-specific code must never reside in the core libraries (`libmem`, `libcore`, `libdevices`, `libtoolchain`, `libdebug`).** Core libraries contain only machine-agnostic abstractions (interfaces, registries, generic helpers). Any class whose name, behavior, or header path implies a specific machine or chip family belongs in the corresponding machine plugin under `src/plugins/`.
>
> The JSON loader (`libcore`) expresses DMA/bus wiring in terms of **generic** concepts rather than named machine-specific classes.

## Sub-Object Specifications

### BusSpec
Defines the main system address bus.
- `type`: Usually `"FlatMemoryBus"`.
- `name`: Identifier for the bus (typically `"system"`).
- `addrBits`: Number of address lines (e.g., `16` for 64 KB).

### CpuSpec
Defines the CPU core and its primary bus connections.
- `type`: CPU core registry key (e.g., `"6502"`, `"6510"`).
- `dataBus`: Name of the bus used for data access.
- `codeBus`: Name of the bus used for instruction fetching.
- `portBusAsData`: (Optional, 6510 specific) If `true`, the CPU's internal port bus is used as the data bus.

### DeviceSpec
Individual hardware components.
- `type`: Device registry key (e.g., `"6522"`, `"6567"`, `"c64_pla"`).
- `name`: Instance name (e.g., `"VIA1"`, `"VIC-II"`).
- `baseAddr`: Hex string of the memory-mapped base address, or `null`.
- `clockHz`: (Optional) Custom clock frequency for the device.
- `colorRam`: (Optional, bool) Indicates the device needs access to the color RAM.
- `dmaBus`: (Optional, bool) Indicates the device needs a DMA bus.
- `lines`: (Optional) Map of device pins to signal names (e.g., `{"ca1": "vsync"}`).
- `linkedDevices`: (Optional) Map of internal device pointers to other named devices.
- `ramData`: (Optional) For banking controllers, the name of the bus providing raw RAM.

### RomSpec
- `label`: Unique identifier for the ROM (e.g., `"kernal"`, `"char"`).
- `path`: Path to the binary file relative to the project root.
- `size`: Size of the ROM in bytes.
- `overlayAddr`: Hex string address where the ROM is mapped to the bus, or `null` if not directly mapped.
- `writable`: (bool) Whether the overlay is writable.
- `passToDevice`: Array of device names that should receive a pointer to this ROM data.

### RamSpec (ramExpansions)
- `name`: Identifier for the RAM block.
- `base`: Hex string base address.
- `size`: Size in bytes.
- `installed`: (bool) Whether this RAM block is present by default.

### SignalSpec
- `name`: Unique signal identifier.
- `type`: `"simple"`, `"shared"`, `"latch"`, or `"nmi"`.
- `sources`: Array of device names or `Device.Line` identifiers that drive this signal.

### KbdWireSpec (kbdWiring)
Wires a keyboard matrix device to I/O ports.
- `device`: Name of the keyboard device instance.
- `colPort`: `{ "device": "...", "port": "A" or "B" }`
- `rowPort`: `{ "device": "...", "port": "A" or "B" }`

### PlaWireSpec (plaWiring)
- `device`: Name of the PLA instance.
- `signals`: Map of PLA inputs to CPU signals (e.g., `{"loram": "loram"}`).

### IoHookSpec (ioHook)
- `mirrorRanges`: Array of objects defining address mirrors:
    - `from`: Hex start of mirror range.
    - `to`: Hex end of mirror range.
    - `target`: Name of the device being mirrored.
    - `targetBase`: Hex base address of the target device.

### SchedSpec (scheduler)
- `type`: Execution policy (usually `"step_tick"`).
- `frameAccumulator`: (Optional) Frame sync settings:
    - `cycles`: Number of cycles per frame.
    - `signal`: Name of the signal to pulse at end of frame (e.g., `"vsync"`).

## Implementation Notes

### Inheritance (`_extends`)
The JSON loader supports a documentation/planned convention of `_extends`. A machine can inherit all properties of a parent machine and only override specific fields. When merging:
- Simple fields are overwritten.
- Arrays (`devices`, `roms`, `ramExpansions`) are usually replaced entirely.
- In some implementations, entries with `"_same": true` in the child's array can be used to copy the parent's entry at that index.

### Device Wiring
The loader automatically wires devices together after instantiation:
1. **Signals**: `SharedIrqManager` or simple lines are created and connected to the `setIrqLine` / `setNmiLine` methods of specified devices.
2. **ROMs**: Pointers to loaded ROM buffers are passed to devices via `setRom(ptr, size)` or specific setters (e.g., `setCharRom`).
3. **I/O Ports**: Port callbacks (like `setPortAWriteCallback`) are installed to handle cross-device communication (e.g., VIC-II bank selection from CIA2).
