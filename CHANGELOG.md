## [0.4.0-dev] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Advanced Expression Evaluator**:
    - Support for high byte (`<`) and low byte (`>`) unary operators.
    - Support for logical negation (`!`).
    - Support for multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulus (`%`).
    - Support for comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).
    - Support for parentheses `( )` to control evaluation order and precedence.
    - Support for character literals (e.g., `'a'`, `'\n'`) returning ASCII values.
    - Disambiguation between modulus `%` and binary literal prefix.
- **Enhanced Debugger GUI**:
    - **DisasmPane Context Menu**: Added a comprehensive right-click menu for breakpoint management, navigation (Go to Address/PC, Follow Operand, Set PC, Go up stack frame), and clipboard operations (Copy Address/Disassembly).
    - **Conditional Breakpoints**: Integrated condition support into the Breakpoint Pane, allowing users to set and edit expressions that must be non-zero to trigger a break.
    - **Breakpoint Management**: Added right-click menu to Breakpoint Pane for toggling, editing conditions, and clearing hit counts.
    - **Memory Sync**: "Show address in memory pane" feature to instantly jump the primary memory view to a specific address from the disassembler.
- **Improved Symbol Support**:
    - Enhanced address-entry dialogs and `Ctrl-G` to resolve machine symbols and complex expressions (e.g., `CHROUT`, `start + 5`).

### Changed
- **UI Refactoring**: Replaced magic numbers in GUI event handlers with structured enums for better maintainability.
- **Expression Parsing**: Enforced strict rules for literal prefixes (`$`, `%`) to prevent ambiguity with whitespace.

## [0.3.0-dev] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Enhanced Symbol Table Management**:
    - CLI: Added `sym` command with `add`, `del`, `list`, `search`, `load`, and `clear` subcommands.
    - GUI: Integrated a new **Symbols** pane with real-time search, manual management, and double-click navigation.
    - MCP: Added `list_symbols`, `add_symbol`, `remove_symbol`, `load_symbols`, and `clear_symbols` tools.
    - Support for multiple `.sym` file formats (`label = value` or `label value`).
- **Core Expression Evaluator**:
    - Implemented a robust recursive-descent parser for addresses and values.
    - Supported formats: Hex (`$prefix` or `0x`), Binary (`%prefix`), and Decimal.
    - Integrated support for using symbols and CPU registers (e.g., `PC + 5`, `start_addr`) in expressions.
    - Integrated the evaluator into all address-taking CLI commands, GUI dialogs, and MCP tools.
- **Kernal Symbols & Monitoring**:
    - Added standard KERNAL symbol tables for C64, VIC-20, and PET machines.
    - Implemented auto-loading of these symbols upon machine creation via the new `symbolFiles` machine configuration field.
    - Added **Kernal Routine Monitoring**: Setting `log level kernal debug` now logs register states upon entry to Kernal routines and displays result states upon matching `RTS` exit.
- **Testing Expansion**:
    - Added 5 new test suites (totaling 153 passing tests) covering Expression Evaluation, Symbol Management, Kernal Autoloading, and C64 I/O logic.

### Fixed
- **Build System**: Fixed several Makefile syntax errors and redundant variable definitions.
- **Datasette/Tape Pane**: Fixed "No Datasette found" error by ensuring `Datasette` and other plugins correctly implement `setName()` and `name()` to match machine configurations.
- **C64 Logic**: Repaired severely broken bit-manipulation logic in the 6510 I/O port (`cpu6510.cpp`).
- **Stability**: Added null checks and move semantics to MCP machine management to prevent crashes and double-free errors.

## [0.2.0-dev] - 2026-04-07 (2)

### Added
- **CLI/MCP parity with GUI memory operations**:

    - CLI: Added `findnext` / `findprior` commands to navigate forward and backward through occurrences of the last `search`/`searcha` pattern (wraps around the full address space).
    - CLI: `search` and `searcha` now report **all** matches, save state for `findnext`/`findprior`, and use the bus address mask instead of the hardcoded `0x10000` range.
    - MCP: Added `swap_memory(machine_id, addr1, addr2, size)` tool, matching the GUI Swap Memory operation.

- **`ExpressionEvaluator`** (`src/libdebug/main/expression_evaluator.h/cpp`): Stub condition evaluator used by `BreakpointList::checkExec/checkWrite/checkRead`; empty condition always matches.
- **CLI breakpoint/watchpoint commands** (`break`, `watch`, `delete`, `enable`, `disable`, `info breaks`) wired to `DebugContext::breakpoints()`.
- **`tests/test_breakpoints.cpp`**: Integration test exercising `create vic20` → assemble JMP loop → `break 0400` → `run 0400` → assert paused at correct PC.

### Changed
- **Test File Location Refactoring**: Moved various tests from the top-level `tests/` directory to their corresponding module-specific `src/plugins/test/<module>/` directories for better organization. Temporarily excluded problematic Atari-specific machine integration tests from the main test executable due to missing machine definitions.

### Fixed
- **Build System**:
    - Repaired corrupted `src/include/util/stb_image_write.h` which had invalid multi-line string literals and macros.
    - Fixed missing initializers for `SimPluginManifest` in multiple plugin initialization files to eliminate compiler warnings.

    - Created directory skeleton for core libraries: `src/libmem/`, `src/libcore/`, `src/libdevices/`, `src/libtoolchain/`, and `src/libdebug/`.
    - Created `roms/` and `tests/` directories.
    - Added `.gitkeep` and `.gitignore` files to ensure proper tracking of empty directories and ignored ROM files.
- **Library Build System:**
    - Extensively updated `Makefile` to support modular builds.
    - Added targets for building static archives (`make libs`) and running tests (`make test`).
    - Configured binaries (`mmemu-cli`, `mmemu-mcp`, `mmemu-gui`) to link against internal libraries.
- **ROM Loader Utility:**
    - Implemented `romLoad` in `src/libcore/rom_loader.h/cpp` for validated binary loading.
- **Documentation:**
    - Created `GEMINI.md` for project overview and quick-start instructions.
    - Created `STYLEGUIDE.md` to establish project-wide coding conventions.

### Changed
- **Directory Reorganization:**
    - Moved global `include/` directory to `src/include/` to centralize all source-related files.
    - Updated `Makefile` and `GEMINI.md` to reflect the new header search paths.
- **Style Alignment:**
    - Updated all architectural specifications (`.plan/arch.md`) and roadmaps (`.plan/todo.md`) to use `camelCase` for variable and function names as per the new style guide.
    - Refactored placeholder headers in `src/` to follow `camelCase` and `PascalCase` conventions.
    - Renamed several identifiers in internal stubs for consistency.

### Fixed
- Fixed build system to correctly handle library object dependencies and include paths.
- Fixed a bug in the 6502 `Mode::REL` implementation where branch targets were calculated incorrectly.
